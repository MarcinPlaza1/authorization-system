## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the improved requirements for an authentication system built using FastAPI in Python, with PostgreSQL as the database. The system will handle user registration, login, logout, password management, and additional features to enhance security, efficiency, and functionality.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this authentication system is to provide a secure and efficient way for users to register, login, and manage their accounts within a FastAPI-based application. The system will ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources and will provide a robust mechanism for session management.

## 3. Scope

- **User Registration:** Allow users to create an account with an email and password.
- **User Login:** Provide a login endpoint that issues a JWT upon successful authentication.
- **User Logout:** Implement a logout mechanism that invalidates the JWT.
- **Password Management:** Include password reset and change features, with rate limiting on reset requests.
- **Token-Based Authentication:** Use JWT for stateless authentication.
- **Admin Access:** Provide administrative endpoints for user management.

## 4. Primary Actors

- **Registered Users:** Users who have registered accounts and can login.
- **Admin Users:** Users with administrative privileges to manage other users.
- **API Clients:** Applications that interact with the authentication endpoints.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 User Registration

- **FR-01:** The system shall allow users to register with a unique email address and a password.
- **FR-02:** The system shall validate the email format during registration.
- **FR-03:** The system shall enforce password complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, presence of special characters).
- **FR-04:** The system shall store passwords securely using a one-way hash function (e.g., bcrypt).

### 5.2 User Login

- **FR-05:** The system shall provide an endpoint for users to login using their email and password.
- **FR-06:** Upon successful login, the system shall generate and return a JWT.
- **FR-07:** The JWT shall contain a `user_id` and `exp` (expiration time) claims.
- **FR-08:** The system shall validate the JWT on protected endpoints.

### 5.3 User Logout

- **FR-09:** The system shall provide an endpoint for users to logout.
- **FR-10:** Logging out shall invalidate the JWT by adding it to a "revoked tokens" list.
- **FR-11:** The system shall check the "revoked tokens" list on each request to protected endpoints.

### 5.4 Password Management

- **FR-12:** The system shall provide an endpoint for users to reset their password.
- **FR-13:** Password reset shall involve sending a reset link to the user's registered email.
- **FR-14:** The system shall allow users to change their password after successful authentication.

### 5.5 Admin Access

- **FR-15:** Admin users shall have access to endpoints for managing other users (e.g., list, delete users).
- **FR-16:** The system shall verify admin privileges before allowing access to administrative endpoints.

### 5.6 Advanced Features

- **FR-17:**User Profile Management: Allow users to update their profiles, including personal details.
- **FR-18:**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement RBAC for fine-grained access management, with admin endpoints protected by role checks.
- **FR-19:**OAuth2 Integration: Support social logins via OAuth2 providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Security

- **NFR-01:** All user passwords must be stored as hashed values and never in plaintext.
- **NFR-02:** The system must use HTTPS for all API endpoints to ensure data transmission security.
- **NFR-03:** JWTs must be securely stored on the client-side and never logged or exposed in error messages.
- **NFR-04:** Audit Logs: Record user actions for monitoring and compliance.
- **NFR-05:** Input Validation: Use ORM ( SQLAlchemy) for database interactions to prevent injection attacks.
- **NFR-06:** Rate Limiting: Implement middleware for rate limiting on sensitive endpoints.

### 6.2 Performance

- **NFR-04:** The system should handle concurrent requests efficiently without significant performance degradation.
- **NFR-05:** JWT expiration times should be set appropriately to balance security and user experience.

### 6.3 Usability

- **NFR-06:** Error messages should be clear and helpful without exposing sensitive information.
- **NFR-07:** The API should be well-documented with Swagger/UI for ease of use by developers.

### 6.4 Compatibility

- **NFR-08:** The system should be compatible with standard HTTP clients and frameworks.
- **NFR-09:** The API should follow RESTful principles where applicable.

### 6.5 Maintainability

- **NFR-10:** The codebase should be well-organized, modular, and follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
- **NFR-11:** All components should be properly documented with comments and docstrings.

### 6.6 Efficiency and Performance

- **NFR-12:** Database Optimization: Use PostgreSQL with proper indexing and constraints for data integrity.
- **NFR-13:** Connection Pooling: Implement connection pooling for database connections.
- **NFR-14:** Caching: Use caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data to improve performance.

## 7. Dependencies

- **FastAPI:** For building the RESTful API.
- **Pydantic:** For data validation and serialization.
- **Passlib:** For password hashing.
- **JWT (python-jwt):** For generating and validating JWTs.
- **Email library:** For sending password reset emails (e.g., `smtplib`).

## 8. Security Considerations

- **CSRF Protection:** Implement CSRF protection for endpoints that modify user data.
- **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks on login and password reset endpoints.
- **Secure Cookies:** If using cookies to store JWTs, ensure they are marked as `HttpOnly` and `Secure`.
- **NFR-07:** JWT Security: Ensure JWTs are securely stored and handle token revocation effectively.
- **NFR-08:** HTTPS: Use HTTPS for all API communications.
- **NFR-09:** Security Headers: Implement headers like Content Security Policy and X-Frame-Options.

## 9. Future Extensions

- **OAuth2 Integration:** Support for OAuth2 providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) for social login.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Implement 2FA for an additional layer of security.
- **User Roles and Permissions:** Introduce role-based access control (RBAC) for fine-grained access management.

## 10. Glossary

- **JWT (JSON Web Token):** An open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- **bcrypt:** A password hashing function designed to be slow and resource-intensive, making it resistant to brute-force attacks.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** A type of attack that forces a user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated.

## 11. Compliance

- **NFR-17:** GDPR Compliance: Implement features for user data deletion and anonymization.
- **NFR-18:** Regulatory Compliance: Ensure the system meets relevant data protection regulations.

## 12. Future Considerations

- **NFR-19:** Multi-Tenancy: Consider support for multiple organizations if needed.
- **NFR-20:** Internationalization: Support multiple languages for error messages and responses.

## 13. Testing and Deployment

- **NFR-21:** Testing: Implement unit and integration tests to ensure system correctness and security.
- **NFR-22:** Deployment: Use environment variables for configuration, especially for sensitive data like database credentials and JWT secrets.

## 14. Monitoring and Logging

- **NFR-23:** Logging: Set up logging mechanisms to detect and respond to security incidents.
- **NFR-24:** Monitoring: Monitor system performance and security events for timely intervention.
