**Project Plan for Authentication System Using FastAPI and PostgreSQL**

---

### 1. **Project Overview**
- **Objective:** Develop a secure and efficient authentication system using FastAPI and PostgreSQL.
- **Key Features:** User registration, login, logout, password management, admin access, and JWT-based authentication.

### 2. **Database Setup**
- **ORM:** Use SQLAlchemy for database interactions.
- **Models:**
  - **User Model:** `user_id`, `email`, `password_hash`, `created_at`, etc.
  - **Roles Table:** For future expansion beyond admin and regular users.

### 3. **Authentication Mechanisms**
- **User Registration:**
  - Unique email validation.
  - Password hashing using bcrypt.
- **User Login:**
  - JWT generation with `user_id` and expiration time.
  - Consider refresh tokens for improved user experience.
- **User Logout:**
  - Implement token revocation or use short-lived tokens with refresh tokens.
- **Password Management:**
  - Password reset via email with expiring tokens.
  - Password change after re-authentication.

### 4. **Admin Access**
- **Endpoints:** 
  - User management (list, delete users).
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) for admin privileges.

### 5. **Security Enhancements**
- **HTTPS:** Ensure all API communications are secure.
- **Security Headers:** Implement Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options.
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent brute force attacks on sensitive endpoints.
- **Input Validation:** Use SQLAlchemy's ORM to prevent injection attacks.

### 6. **Performance Optimization**
- **Database:** Use indexing and constraints for data integrity.
- **Connection Pooling:** Manage database connections efficiently.
- **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed data.

### 7. **Testing and Deployment**
- **Testing:**
  - Unit tests for endpoints.
  - Integration tests for overall system functionality.
  - Use pytest for testing framework.
- **Deployment:**
  - Use Docker for containerization.
  - Environment variables for configurations.
  - Consider Nginx for serving HTTPS.

### 8. **Compliance and Logging**
- **GDPR Compliance:** Allow user data requests and deletions.
- **Logging:** Use a logging library with different levels; avoid logging sensitive information.

### 9. **Documentation and User Experience**
- **API Documentation:** Use Swagger/UI for comprehensive documentation.
- **README:** Guide for setting up the environment, running the app, and performing tests.
- **Error Handling:** Provide clear, user-friendly error messages.

### 10. **Future Considerations**
- **OAuth2 Integration:** For social logins.
- **Multi-Tenancy and Internationalization:** For future scalability and language support.

### 11. **Project Timeline**
- **Phase 1:** Database setup and models.
- **Phase 2:** Implement user registration and login.
- **Phase 3:** Password management features.
- **Phase 4:** Admin access and security enhancements.
- **Phase 5:** Testing and deployment.

### 12. **Version Control**
- **Git:** Use Git for version control, with frequent commits and clear commit messages.

### 13. **Backup and Recovery**
- **Database Backups:** Regular backups and a recovery plan for data integrity.
